# breeze-signal
Extensions to breeze for signal processing.

This is not ready for prime time.  So for now, just consider this a person 
repository until some useful functionality is there.

The purpose of this project is to add functionality signal processing 
in a Scala-esque manner to breeze.  Functionality will be similar to that
what you get in Matlab/Octave/SciPy signal processing libraries.

If anyone is interested in helping, please do not hesitate in doing so.

Since I need it for a project, we'll start with concentrating on FIR filter
design and processing with FIR filters.
